# 2017 EarthCube netCDF-CF Workshop

**Advancing netCDF-CF for the Geosciences**

**6-8 September 2017, Boulder, Colorado**

***[Original website hosted at Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/events/2017CFWorkshop/ "Unidata's website")***

This workshop will focus on efforts to advance the Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions for
netCDF (netCDF-CF). The meeting is being hosted by the EarthCube “Advancing netCDF-CF for Geoscience”
project, which is funded by the US National Science Foundation's EarthCube program.

**This workshop is sponsored by the National Science Foundation** ![National Science Foundation](2017-workshop/nsf-50x50.png)
