# 2020 CF Workshop

The 2020 CF Workshop will be virtual on 9-11 June 2020.
The meeting will run for only 3 hours on each day, 16:00 to 19:00 UTC,
and will be followed by a short purely social time for those who can, and want to, stay on.

**Registration**

Please [register](https://forms.gle/RoKHT4h8hnBN23Pk7) so we can get an idea
of the numbers of participants. There is, of course, no fee!
The registration form also asks you to express your interest in the
Current Discussion Topics sessions that will be discussed in the breakout sessions
on day 2 and 3. Please select as many of these as are of interest, even though the discussions
are happening in parallel, as it will be useful to have a rough idea of numbers for each session.

The list of discussion topics and a link to a
[document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1urPWngzDCuHTrfpA8nedGoRDVKXs5OmjqO8M6i3UZJM/edit)
that contains a very short summary of each topic is available below and on the registration
form to help you decide which one, or ones, you might like to discuss.
Many thanks to everyone who compiled it at short notice.
