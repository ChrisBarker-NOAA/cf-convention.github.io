# 2020 CF Workshop
 
The 2020 CF Workshop will be held in Santander, Spain on 10-11 June 2020
with a half day training event on the preceding afternoon (9 June 2020).
It will be hosted by [University of Cantabria][UCantabria].

The dates may be fixed, but the content is not.
The broad areas we expect to cover could include:

* Governance
* Unresolved proposals for enhancements to CF
* CF procedures (e.g. GitHub, standard names, ...)

so any specific suggestions on these topics, or anything else, will be most welcome.

The training event will focus on how to interact with CF systems and processes,
such as how to use GitHub to suggest enhancements,
and how best to get new standard names accepted.
Again, please let us know of specific items
that you might find useful for this part of the workshop.

Many thanks, and we hope to see you there (in person or virtually)
